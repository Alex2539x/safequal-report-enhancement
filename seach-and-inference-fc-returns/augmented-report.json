"The patient recently underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to severe osteoarthritis, and they also have a history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed to address recurrent gallstones. Upon admission, the patient's mobility status was assessed as \"Level 2,\" requiring assistance for ambulation, and they were advised to seek help for at least 48 hours post-surgery to ensure safety and stability. Despite prior falls, including two incidents within the last six months attributed to a loose rug and balance issues during physical therapy, the patient demonstrated a commitment to their rehabilitation plan. Following a recent fall incident, a comprehensive neurological assessment and infection control measures were implemented, along with a revised care plan emphasizing increased monitoring and a fall prevention protocol. The patient's family expressed concern, actively engaging in the care process and receiving emotional support resources. Overall, a thorough assessment identified potential environmental hazards, which prompted further safety measures to mitigate risks and enhance patient recovery."
