The patient, who recently underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to severe osteoarthritis, experienced mobility issues that temporarily hindered their recovery. Prior to a concerning incident, the patient attempted to get out of bed unassisted three times, with the most recent attempt leading to disorientation. To mitigate fall risks, bright signs and a color-coded wristband were used, accompanied by a specialized fall prevention program including non-slip footwear and regular staff rounding. Moreover, during a distressing episode involving aggressive behavior, staff implemented de-escalation techniques such as active listening and calm communication. The situation prompted varied reactions from other patients, ranging from concern to attempts at calming the atmosphere, showcasing the emotional impact of the incident within the emergency department.

The patient recently underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to severe osteoarthritis but had a notable history of prior surgery, specifically a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to remove their gallbladder due to recurrent gallstones. Upon admission, their mobility was limited, classified as "Level 2" on the mobility scale, necessitating assistance while ambulating. To enhance safety, protocols such as comprehensive risk assessments and effective infection control measures were implemented. Following a recent aggressive episode, de-escalation techniques were utilized by both staff and security, while additional measures were discussed during staff debriefings to improve communication and support. Unfortunately, environmental hazards, such as a loose rug and clutter around the bed, contributed to a fall that prompted targeted follow-up care, including medical evaluations and tailored physical therapy. The patient demonstrated a clear understanding of their mobility restrictions and was committed to adhering to their rehabilitation plan.

The patient recently underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to severe osteoarthritis, and they also have a history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed to address recurrent gallstones. Upon admission, the patient's mobility status was assessed as "Level 2," requiring assistance for ambulation, and they were advised to seek help for at least 48 hours post-surgery to ensure safety and stability. Despite prior falls, including two incidents within the last six months attributed to a loose rug and balance issues during physical therapy, the patient demonstrated a commitment to their rehabilitation plan. Following a recent fall incident, a comprehensive neurological assessment and infection control measures were implemented, along with a revised care plan emphasizing increased monitoring and a fall prevention protocol. The patient's family expressed concern, actively engaging in the care process and receiving emotional support resources. Overall, a thorough assessment identified potential environmental hazards, which prompted further safety measures to mitigate risks and enhance patient recovery.

**Incident Report: Patient Fall Post-Total Knee Arthroplasty**

The patient recently underwent total knee arthroplasty (TKA) due to severe osteoarthritis and has a history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy performed to address recurrent gallstones. Upon admission, the patient's mobility status was assessed as "Level 2," indicating a need for assistance during ambulation. They were advised to wait for assistance for at least 48 hours post-surgery to ensure safety and stability.

Despite prior falls, including two incidents within the last six months—one attributed to a loose rug at home and another occurring during physical therapy—the patient demonstrated a clear understanding of their mobility restrictions and expressed commitment to adhering to their rehabilitation plan.

Following a recent fall incident, a comprehensive neurological assessment was executed to evaluate cognitive function, motor skills, and sensory responses. Infection control measures were also put in place immediately. The healthcare team implemented a revised care plan emphasizing increased monitoring and a fall prevention protocol tailored to the patient’s specific needs.

The patient's family expressed concern about the incident and actively engaged in the care process. They received information on ongoing treatment options and were offered emotional support resources to help cope with the stress of the situation.

Overall, a thorough environmental assessment identified potential hazards, such as clutter around the bed, which prompted further safety measures to mitigate risks and enhance recovery.
