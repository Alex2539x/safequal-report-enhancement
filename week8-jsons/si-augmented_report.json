    "augmented_report": "\"The patient recently underwent bilateral hip arthroplasty and was previously noted to have undergone a laparoscopic cholecystectomy, highlighting their significant medical history due to severe osteoarthritis and symptomatic gallstones. Currently five days into recovery post-surgery, they face rehabilitation challenges for strength and mobility restoration, while also contending with known fall risks due to vestibular dysfunction. Although the patient understood the importance of calling for assistance, they mobilized unassisted multiple times, exacerbating their symptoms. Environmental hazards, including clutter, inadequate lighting, and unsecured carpets, contributed to these falls. Immediate nursing response ensured patient safety, with vital checks performed efficiently. Existing safety protocols were in place but may require enhancements, such as further education and additional assessments, to better manage fall risks and optimize recovery.\""
